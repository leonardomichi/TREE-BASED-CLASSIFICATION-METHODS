# TREE-BASED-CLASSIFICATION-METHODS
• Thesis on tree-based machine learning classification algorithms such as random forest, boosting and bagging.

• Application of these algorithms to classify tumors as benign or malignant with 98% accuracy through adaboost.

• Application of these algorithms for comparison with parametric methods such as logistic regression, naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis in which the random forest had a 
  higher accuracy of 6%.
